# Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms
A repository containing Artificial Intelligence algorithms for Supervised, Unsupervised, Deep and Reinforcement Learning tasks. 
A blend of Numpy, PyTorch and JAX library usage from Python to provide state-of-the-art implementations.

If you would like to run the code stand alone i.e. be able to do further analysis with the algorithms, you may have to pre-process your data before applying the algorithms.
