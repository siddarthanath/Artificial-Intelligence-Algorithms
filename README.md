# Artificial-Intelligence-And-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
A suite containing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms for Supervised, Unsupervised, Deep and Reinforcement Learning tasks. 
A blend of Numpy, PyTorch and JAX library usage from Python to provide state-of-the-art implementations.

If you would like to run the code stand alone i.e. be able to do further analysis with the algorithms, you will have to alter the _main_ function by either: 

1) Removing it entirely and create another method inside the class (which mimics the functionality of the _main_ function - this is for users who wish to execute the file via a notebook).
2) Alter the _main_ to return what you need (this for those who wish to execute the code via terminal). 

Additionally, since the code has been created with an associated dataset, if you would like to use your own dataset, you will have to slightly change the _main_ function in each of the files.
